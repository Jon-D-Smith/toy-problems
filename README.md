As I continue to practice JavaScript, I will update this repository to host my methods for common problems. The problem sets may be "toy problems" from potential interviews, or data structures and algorithms. This is by no means meant to be a comprehensive list of all available "toy problems" or data structures/algorithms.


To run any of these programs locally, you will need to clone them to your device, open your terminal (to the parent folder) and run "node filename.js".


*Running this program locally will require node.js to be installed to your machine.
